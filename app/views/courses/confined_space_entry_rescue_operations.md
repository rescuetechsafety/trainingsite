Participants will also fulfill all three positional requirements.

This course is designed to enable students to recognize, evaluate, prevent and abate safety and health hazards associated with confined space entry. Technical topics include the recognition of confined space hazards, basic information about instrumentation used to evaluate atmospheric hazards, and ventilation techniques. This course features practice with permit entry classification and program evaluation. hazards associated with these spaces and understanding the regulations covering confined spaces.

This course teaches students how to conduct a variety of rescues in permit-required confined spaces.  Students will learn how to develop and update pre-plans, conduct practice rescues, inspect and maintain equipment, and coordinate with other emergency responders.

This training will primarily consist of hands-on field training and is 40-hours in length.
